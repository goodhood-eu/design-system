    * Automated Testing
        * migrate tests to applications and libraries
        * implement automated testing
        * enforce succeeding tests on PRs
    * Automated Code Analysis
        * implement sonarqube
        * enforce code quality on PRs

## Project / Package Visibility

* Everything should be private by default
* All repos should be in the good-hood-gmbh org
* the goodhood repo (service library) contains all shared service / helper / type / util packages
* @goodhood/nebenan-web should be the main frontend in the future
* @goodhood/ui, @goodhood/services are not included in the monorepo since they are used in the old and new applications during the transition phase


github org: good-hood-gmbh
npm org: @goodhood

  * create biz post
  * /feed -> @goodhood/nebenan-web/feed/index.ts


### @goodhood/goodhood -> service lib

* [x] Base Components
* [x] Styling Framework
* [/] Conventions
* [x] Design Tokens
* [/] Testing Framework


###  nice to have
