Technical Story: [description | ticket/issue URL] 

## Context and Problem Statement

Code across all Libraries and Applications should be consistent. This is especially important for the UI-Library, which is used by all Applications.
### UI Library
UI-Library will be split into Components and Blocks. Components are simple and compound components.
Blocks are a combination of Components and only used as a template for Applications.
### Applications

Applications should be split into different business domains (e.g ) in order to be able to scale the development team.
Each business domain should have its own folder in the Application.
Each business domain should have its own routes file.
Each business domain should have its own pages folder.
Each business domain might have its own components folder.



### Definitions

#### Component (simple and compound components)
A Component is a single Atom in the UI-Library. Atoms are defined by Design.
Components always export a single Component. All Sub-Components should be accessible via the main Component.

#### Block

A Block is a combination of (complex) Components. Blocks are just examples for using components in applications.
Blocks can't be imported in applications as they are basically only templates

## Decision Drivers

* [driver 1, e.g., a force, facing concern, …]
* [driver 2, e.g., a force, facing concern, …]
* … 

## Considered Options

* [option 1]
* [option 2]
* [option 3]
* … 

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[option 1]", because [justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force force | … | comes out best (see below)].
