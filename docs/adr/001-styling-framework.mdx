## Pros and Cons of the Options

### CSS Modules

[[Github Repo](https://github.com/gajus/react-css-modules)  | description | pointer to more information | …]

* Good, because CSS will never be deprecated
* Good, because developers are familiar to it
* Bad, because dynamic styles are only possible by changing class-names
* Bad, Only standard CSS available
* Bad, theming is not easy to implement
* Bad, because there is a custom*ish toolchain needed to compile the scss files


#### Repo Stats

* deprecated
* native to react

### SCSS Modules

[example | description | pointer to more information | …]

* Good, because Variables and Mixins can be used
* Good, because developers are familiar to it
* Good, because there is already SCSS code in the codebase
* Bad, because dynamic styles are only possible by changing class-names
* Bad, because there is a custom*ish toolchain needed to compile the scss files

#### Repo Stats

* deprecated (since its just css modules with a scss preprocessor)
* native to react

### Styled Components (js in css)

[[Github Repo](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) | description | pointer to more information | …]

* Good, because it's deeply integrated into react
* Good, because it handles dynamic styles very well (props and stuff)
* Bad, because it's tightly coupled to code
* Bad, because it's not easy to use with other frameworks (e.g. Angular)
* Bad, because there is a learning curve
* *Bad, because there is a custom\*ish toolchain needed to do serverside rendering*
